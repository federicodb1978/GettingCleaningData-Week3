=============================================================================================

The experiment is described in details in the link above.

=============================================================================================

## Steps to reproduce the project

1. Download the original data set found in https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

2. Run the script run_analysis.R


=============================================================================================

## Outputs

1. The tidy dataset in the file “data_summary.txt”

2. README.md (this file) describing the project

3. Codebook.md describing main variable

=============================================================================================
## The Request

The request is the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


=============================================================================================

## Script description and script solution

The task requested is resolved in 3 parts.

Part 1
In the first part, I have answered questions 1, 3 and 4, creating a complete dataset with meaningful variable names

Part 2
In the second part, I have answered question 2, and I have created mean and standard deviation

Part 3
In the third part, I have answered question number 5, creating a tidy dataset with the average of each column per subject and activity
